# Data Analysis with Pandas
## PyLadies Vancouver Workshop

In this workshop, we will dive into the Pandas library - Python's powerhouse for data wrangling and analysis. With an emphasis on exploratory data analysis techniques, we'll work with real-world data to develop fundamental Pandas skills, including:

- Reading and writing CSV files
- Basic calculations and graphs with Pandas data structures
- Summary statistics for numerical and categorical data
- Sorting and filtering
- Grouping and aggregation
- Indexing and subsets

### Skill Level: Intermediate
To get the most out of this workshop, you'll want to be already comfortable with Python basics. You do not need any prior experience with Pandas or any other libraries.

### Setup
You'll want to bring your laptop for lots of hands-on practice as we work through the lessons and exercises. We'll be using Python 3.6, JupyterLab, and Pandas.

Please make sure to download and install the required libraries on your laptop prior to the workshop. For setup instructions, please **[click here](https://jenfly.github.io/pyladies-pandas/SETUP)**.

### Instructor
Jennifer Walker is an environmental scientist at UBC, spending most of her days blissfully analyzing data in Python. When she's not working on her academic research, she can often be found around town teaching Ladies Learning Code workshops or volunteering as an analyst and data ambassador with Data for Good.
